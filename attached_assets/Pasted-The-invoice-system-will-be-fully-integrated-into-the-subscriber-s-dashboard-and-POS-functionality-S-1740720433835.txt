The invoice system will be fully integrated into the subscriberâ€™s dashboard and POS functionality. Subscribers can create invoices dynamically for any transaction, customize their design, and manage payment options (full, partial, or none; cash or online). A separate admin-only page will track logs, and the admin can toggle features on/off or clear caches as needed.

Detailed Features:
1. Invoice Creation and Integration
POS Integration:
Generate an invoice automatically from a POS transaction (e.g., after adding items to the cart and processing payment).
Option to create standalone invoices without POS (e.g., for bulk sales or purchases).
Invoice Fields:
Auto-populated: Invoice number (unique, sequential), date, company logo/name, client details (name, email, phone), itemized list (product name, quantity, unit price, subtotal).
Editable: Tax rate, discount, additional notes, payment terms.
Transaction Flexibility: Support invoices for both buying (from suppliers) and selling (to customers).
Multi-Currency: Allow subscribers to select currency (e.g., USD, EUR) with conversion rates (optional API integration, e.g., ExchangeRate-API).
2. Customizable Invoice Design
Design Tool:
Provide a drag-and-drop editor to customize invoice layout (e.g., move logo, adjust table placement, add footer).
Pre-built templates (e.g., modern, classic, minimal) as starting points.
Branding: Allow upload of company logo, custom fonts, and color schemes.
Dynamic Fields: Option to add/remove fields (e.g., VAT number, terms of service).
Preview: Real-time preview of the invoice design before saving.
Save Templates: Subscribers can save multiple custom templates and choose one per invoice.
3. Payment Options

Filter logs by date, action type, or user.
Cache Management:
Option to dynamically clear system cache (e.g., for performance optimization).
Confirmation prompt before clearing.
