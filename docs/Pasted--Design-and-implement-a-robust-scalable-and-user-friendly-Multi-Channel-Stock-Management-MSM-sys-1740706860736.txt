"Design and implement a robust, scalable, and user-friendly Multi-Channel Stock Management (MSM) system using React, TypeScript, and a modern tech stack. The system should cater to businesses managing inventory across multiple channels, warehouses, and suppliers, with the following features and requirements:

1. Multi-Channel Stock Management
Real-Time Inventory Tracking:
Monitor stock levels across multiple locations (warehouses, stores) in real time.
Use WebSocket or polling to sync updates instantly across the UI.
Display stock status (e.g., available, reserved, in-transit) with color-coded indicators.
Multi-Warehouse & Multi-Store Support:
Enable stock management for multiple warehouses and retail locations.
Support stock transfers between locations with a detailed transfer history.
Provide a location filter on the dashboard (e.g., dropdown or map view).
Multi-Supplier & Multi-Customer Support:
Maintain a searchable database of suppliers and customers with fields (e.g., name, contact, address, terms).
Link stock movements to specific suppliers/customers for traceability.
Barcode & QR Code Scanning:
Integrate barcode/QR code scanning via webcam or mobile device camera.
Allow bulk stock updates (e.g., add/remove items) using scan results.
Support custom barcode generation for internal use.
Stock Adjustments & Transfers:
Provide forms for manual stock adjustments (e.g., damage, loss, returns) with reason codes.
Automate transfer workflows with approval steps for large moves.
2. Automated Inventory Control & Optimization
Low Stock Alerts & Reorder Notifications:
Set customizable minimum stock thresholds per product/location.
Send real-time alerts (email, in-app toast) when stock falls below thresholds.
Automated Purchase Order Generation:
Generate purchase orders based on low stock or forecasted demand.
Allow manual review/edit before submission to suppliers.
Batch & Expiry Date Tracking:
Track batches/lots with expiry dates for perishable goods.
Highlight expiring items on the dashboard with configurable warning periods (e.g., 30 days).
Lot & Serial Number Tracking:
Assign and track lot/serial numbers for serialized inventory.
Provide a searchable history for compliance audits.
3. Advanced Reporting & Analytics
Real-Time Dashboard:
Display key metrics (e.g., total stock value, top movers, low stock) with live updates.
Use charts (e.g., bar, line) for sales trends and stock levels.
Customizable Reports:
Generate reports on stock valuation, turnover, shrinkage, etc.
Allow users to filter by date, location, or product category and export (PDF, CSV).
AI-Powered Demand Forecasting:
Integrate a machine learning model (e.g., via an API) to predict demand based on historical sales data.
Suggest optimal reorder quantities and timing.
ABC Inventory Analysis:
Categorize inventory into A (high-value), B (moderate), and C (low-value) items.
Visualize analysis results with a table or pie chart.
4. Seamless Order & Supplier Management
Purchase Order Management:
Create, edit, and track purchase orders with statuses (e.g., pending, shipped, received).
Auto-populate supplier details and item lists.
Sales Order & Invoice Management:
Manage sales orders with automated invoice generation.
Support partial fulfillment and backorder tracking.
Dropshipping & Supplier Integration:
Enable dropshipping workflows where suppliers fulfill orders directly.
Integrate with supplier APIs for real-time stock sync.
Vendor & Supplier Rating System:
Rate suppliers based on metrics (e.g., accuracy, delivery speed, quality).
Display ratings in a supplier dashboard with historical trends.
5. User Roles & Access Control
Multi-User Access with Role-Based Permissions:
Define roles (e.g., admin, manager, staff) with granular permissions (e.g., view-only, edit stock).
Manage user invitations and role assignments via an admin panel.
Audit Trail & Activity Logs:
Log all user actions (e.g., stock updates, logins) with timestamps and user IDs.
Provide a filterable audit log UI for compliance checks.
6. Integrations & API Support
E-commerce Integration:
Sync inventory and orders with platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and Magento via their APIs.
Handle real-time updates for stock levels and order statuses.
Accounting Software Integration:
Connect with QuickBooks, Xero, and Zoho Books for financial data sync (e.g., invoices, stock value).
Automate journal entries for stock movements.
Shipping & Logistics Integration:
Integrate with FedEx, UPS, and DHL for shipping label generation and tracking.
Provide a unified shipping status view.
Third-Party API Access:
Expose a RESTful API (e.g., /api/stock, /api/orders) with OAuth2 authentication.
Include detailed API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI).
7. Multi-Language & Multi-Currency Support
Global Language Support:
Implement react-i18next for multi-language UI (e.g., English, Spanish, French).
Allow users to switch languages dynamically.
Multi-Currency & Tax Support:
Support multiple currencies with real-time exchange rate updates (e.g., via an API like OpenExchangeRates).
Apply region-specific tax rules with customizable tax tables.
8. Mobile & Cloud-Based Access
Progressive Web App (PWA) & Mobile Optimization:
Build a PWA with a manifest and service worker for offline access and installation.
Optimize UI/UX for mobile devices (e.g., touch-friendly buttons, responsive layouts).
Offline Mode:
Cache critical data (e.g., stock levels, orders) in IndexedDB or local storage.
Sync changes automatically when connectivity is restored.
9. Security & Compliance
End-to-End Encryption & Secure Authentication:
Use HTTPS and encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API tokens) with AES-256.
Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.
GDPR & HIPAA Compliance:
Provide data export/deletion options for users.
Store health-related data (if applicable) with HIPAA-compliant measures.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
Enable 2FA via email, SMS, or authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator).
10. Subscription Plans & Pricing
Flexible Pricing Models:
Offer tiered plans (e.g., Basic: $10/mo, Pro: $30/mo, Enterprise: custom) with feature limits.
